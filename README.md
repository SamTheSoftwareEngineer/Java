# Java

This repo is a collection of example code and notes that I've written in Java, based off the course that is given by 
Sophia learning, located at www.sophia.org, particulary in the Introduction to Java course. The course covers the basics of Java syntax, variables, control flow, and more. I hope that you will find this repo useful and I hope to use it as a reference for Java syntax in the future!
